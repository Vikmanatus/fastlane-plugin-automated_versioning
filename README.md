## About automated_versioning

A simple fastlane plugin to help automate versioning of mobile applications


Maintaining the versioning of your mobile application is an important key indicator showing the chronological evolution of your project, however sometimes it can happen that before a release the `build_number` or `code_version` has been incorrectly entered...

The goal of this plugin is to help you automate the process of versioning so you don't have to worry about it and you can focus on your project.

### Versioning schemes supported

- Sementic versioning

  - `generated_build_number`: `build_number` and `code_version` are generated according to the `version` number
  - `auto_increment`: the `build_number` and `code_version` will start from 0 and will be auto incremented

- Date of Release

Feel free to send me a message if you find other versioning schemes that we could support in this plugin ðŸ˜ƒ
